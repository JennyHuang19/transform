INTRODUCTION-way


Confucius-way was-way born-way in-way the-way year-way 550-way B.C.,[1]-way in-way the-way land-way of-way Lu,-way in-way a-way
small-way village,-way situated-way in-way the-way western-way part-way of-way the-way modern-way province-way of-way
Shantung.-way His-way name-way was-way K'ung-way Ch'iu,-way and-way his-way style-way (corresponding-way to-way
our-way Christian-way name)-way was-way Chung-ni.-way His-way countrymen-way speak-way of-way him-way as-way K'ung-way
Fu-tzu,-way the-way Master,-way or-way philosopher-way K'ung.-way This-way expression-way was-way altered-way
into-way Confucius-way by-way the-way Jesuit-way missionaries-way who-way first-way carried-way his-way fame-way
to-way Europe.-way

[Footnote-way 1:-way According-way to-way the-way great-way historian-way Ssu-ma-way Ch'ien.-way Other-way
authorities-way say,-way 552-way and-way 551-way B.C.]-way

Since-way the-way golden-way days-way of-way the-way Emperors-way Yao-way and-way Shun,-way the-way legendary-way
founders-way of-way the-way Chinese-way Empire,-way nearly-way two-way thousand-way years-way had-way passed.-way
Shun-way chose-way as-way his-way successor-way Yü,-way who-way had-way been-way his-way chief-way minister,-way a-way man-way
whose-way devotion-way to-way duty-way was-way such-way that-way when-way engaged-way in-way draining-way the-way
empire-way of-way the-way great-way flood--a-way task-way that-way took-way eight-way years-way to-way
accomplish--he-way never-way entered-way his-way home-way till-way the-way work-way was-way done,-way although-way
in-way the-way course-way of-way his-way labours-way he-way had-way thrice-way to-way pass-way his-way door.-way He-way
founded-way the-way Hsia-way dynasty,-way which-way lasted-way till-way 1766-way B.C.-way The-way last-way emperor-way
of-way this-way line,-way a-way vile-way tyrant,-way was-way overthrown-way by-way T'ang,-way who-way became-way the-way
first-way ruler-way of-way the-way house-way of-way Shang,-way or-way Yin.-way This-way dynasty-way again-way
degenerated-way in-way course-way of-way time-way and-way came-way to-way an-way end-way in-way Chou,-way or-way Chou-way Hsin-way
(1154-22-way B.C.),-way a-way monster-way of-way lust,-way extravagance,-way and-way cruelty.-way The-way
empire-way was-way only-way held-way together-way by-way the-way strength-way and-way wisdom-way of-way the-way Duke-way
of-way Chou,-way or-way King-way Wen,-way to-way give-way him-way his-way popular-way title,-way one-way of-way the-way
greatest-way men-way in-way Chinese-way history.-way He-way controlled-way two-thirds-way of-way the-way
empire;-way but,-way believing-way that-way the-way people-way were-way not-way yet-way ready-way for-way a-way
change,-way he-way refrained-way from-way dethroning-way the-way emperor.-way In-way his-way day-way 'the-way
husbandman-way paid-way one-way in-way nine;-way the-way pay-way of-way the-way officers-way was-way hereditary;-way
men-way were-way questioned-way at-way barriers-way and-way at-way markets,-way but-way there-way were-way no-way
tolls;-way fishgarths-way were-way not-way preserved;-way the-way children-way of-way criminals-way were-way
sackless.-way The-way old-way and-way wifeless--the-way widower;-way the-way old-way and-way
husbandless--the-way widow;-way the-way old-way and-way childless--the-way lone-way one;-way the-way young-way
and-way fatherless--the-way orphan;-way these-way four-way are-way the-way people-way most-way in-way need-way
below-way heaven,-way and-way they-way have-way no-way one-way to-way whom-way to-way cry,-way so-way when-way King-way Wen-way
reigned-way his-way love-way went-way out-way first-way to-way them'-way (Mencius,-way Book-way II,-way chapter-way
5).-way After-way his-way death,-way his-way son,-way King-way Wu,-way decided-way that-way the-way nation-way was-way
ripe-way for-way change.-way He-way overcame-way Chou-way Hsin-way by-way force-way of-way arms,-way and,-way placing-way
himself-way on-way the-way throne,-way became-way the-way founder-way of-way the-way Chou-way dynasty.-way

In-way the-way time-way of-way Confucius-way the-way Chou-way dynasty-way still-way filled-way the-way throne.-way But-way
it-way had-way long-way since-way become-way effete,-way and-way all-way power-way had-way passed-way into-way the-way
hands-way of-way the-way great-way vassals.-way The-way condition-way of-way China-way was-way much-way like-way that-way
of-way Germany-way in-way the-way worst-way days-way of-way the-way Holy-way Roman-way Empire.-way The-way emperor-way was-way
powerless,-way the-way various-way vassal-way states-way were-way independent-way in-way all-way but-way name,-way
and-way often-way at-way war-way one-way with-way the-way other.-way These-way states-way again-way were-way
disintegrated,-way and-way their-way rulers-way impotent-way against-way encroaching-way
feudatories.-way In-way Confucius'-way native-way state,-way Lu,-way the-way duke-way was-way a-way mere-way
shadow.-way The-way younger-way branches-way of-way his-way house-way had-way usurped-way all-way power.-way Three-way
in-way number,-way they-way were-way called-way the-way Three-way Clans.-way The-way most-way important-way of-way the-way
three-way was-way the-way Chi,-way or-way Chi-sun-way clan,-way whose-way chiefs-way Chi-way Huan-way and-way Chi-way
K'ang-way are-way often-way mentioned-way by-way Confucius.-way But-way the-way power-way of-way the-way Chi,-way too,-way
was-way ill-secured.-way The-way minister-way Yang-way Huo-way overawed-way his-way master,-way and-way once-way
even-way threw-way him-way into-way prison.-way Nor-way was-way the-way condition-way of-way the-way other-way states-way
of-way the-way empire-way better-way than-way that-way of-way Lu.-way Confucius-way thought-way it-way worse.-way

Into-way this-way turbulent-way world-way Confucius-way was-way born.-way Though-way his-way father-way was-way
only-way a-way poor-way military-way officer,-way he-way could-way trace-way his-way descent-way from-way the-way
imperial-way house-way of-way Yin.-way Confucius-way married-way at-way nineteen,-way and-way is-way known-way to-way
have-way had-way one-way son-way and-way one-way daughter.-way Shortly-way after-way his-way marriage-way he-way
entered-way the-way service-way of-way the-way state-way as-way keeper-way of-way the-way granary.-way A-way year-way
later-way he-way was-way put-way in-way charge-way of-way the-way public-way fields.-way In-way 527-way B.C.-way his-way
mother-way died,-way and,-way in-way obedience-way to-way Chinese-way custom,-way he-way had-way to-way retire-way
from-way public-way life.-way When-way the-way years-way of-way mourning-way were-way over,-way he-way did-way not-way
again-way take-way office,-way but-way devoted-way himself-way instead-way to-way study-way and-way teaching.-way
As-way the-way years-way rolled-way by-way his-way fame-way grew,-way and-way a-way band-way of-way pupils-way gathered-way
round-way him.-way In-way 517-way B.C.-way the-way anarchy-way in-way Lu-way reached-way such-way a-way pitch-way that-way
Confucius-way moved-way to-way the-way neighbouring-way land-way of-way Ch'i.-way Here-way he-way had-way several-way
interviews-way with-way the-way reigning-way duke,-way but-way met-way with-way little-way encouragement-way
(xviii.-way 3).-way So-way he-way soon-way returned-way to-way his-way native-way country,-way and-way resumed-way for-way
fifteen-way years-way his-way work-way as-way student-way and-way teacher.-way

During-way these-way fifteen-way years-way the-way power-way of-way the-way duke-way sank-way lower-way and-way lower,-way
and-way the-way Chi-way was-way menaced-way by-way his-way minister-way Yang-way Huo.-way In-way times-way so-way dark,-way
men-way that-way loved-way quiet-way sought-way in-way the-way world-way of-way thought-way an-way escape-way from-way the-way
gloom-way around-way them,-way whilst-way others-way that-way were-way less-way resigned-way turned-way over-way
in-way their-way minds-way the-way causes-way of-way the-way realm's-way decay.-way Lao-tzu,-way the-way founder-way
of-way the-way mystic-way Taoist-way philosophy,-way taught-way that-way in-way inaction-way alone-way peace-way
can-way be-way found;-way Mo-tzu-way proclaimed-way the-way doctrine-way of-way universal-way love:-way that-way
we-way should-way love-way all-way men-way as-way we-way love-way self,-way love-way the-way parents-way of-way others-way as-way
we-way love-way our-way own-way parents.-way Upright-way men-way were-way driven-way or-way fled-way from-way the-way
world.-way Confucius-way often-way met-way them-way in-way his-way wanderings,-way and-way was-way reproved-way
for-way not-way doing-way as-way they-way did.-way But-way his-way practical-way mind-way told-way him-way that-way
inaction-way could-way not-way help-way the-way world,-way and-way that-way to-way find-way a-way remedy-way for-way the-way
nation's-way ills,-way their-way cause-way must-way first-way be-way learned.-way This-way could-way only-way be-way
done-way by-way historical-way study.-way He-way therefore-way devoted-way himself-way to-way the-way study-way of-way
past-way times,-way edited-way in-way later-way life-way the-way _Book-way of-way History_,-way and-way compiled-way
the-way work-way called-way _Spring-way and-way Autumn_,-way a-way history-way of-way his-way native-way state-way
from-way 722-way to-way 481-way B.C.-way To-way bring-way again-way the-way golden-way days-way of-way Yao-way and-way Shun-way a-way
return-way must-way be-way made-way to-way the-way principles-way of-way Wen-way and-way Wu,-way the-way kings-way that-way
had-way rebuilt-way the-way empire-way after-way tyranny-way and-way selfishness-way had-way laid-way it-way low.-way
Of-way impracticable-way ideals-way and-way renunciation-way of-way the-way world-way no-way good-way could-way
come.-way

At-way last-way in-way 501-way B.C.-way Yang-way Huo-way was-way forced-way to-way flee-way from-way Lu,-way and-way prospects-way
brightened.-way A-way year-way later-way Confucius-way was-way appointed-way governor-way of-way a-way town.-way
So-way great-way was-way his-way success-way as-way governor-way that-way before-way long-way he-way was-way promoted-way
to-way be-way Superintendent-way of-way Works,-way and-way then-way to-way be-way Chief-way Criminal-way Judge.-way He-way
won-way great-way influence-way with-way his-way master,-way and-way did-way much-way to-way lighten-way the-way
general-way misery.-way He-way so-way strengthened-way the-way power-way of-way the-way duke-way that-way
neighbouring-way states-way grew-way jealous.-way To-way sow-way dissension-way between-way duke-way and-way
minister-way the-way men-way of-way Ch'i-way sent-way the-way duke-way a-way gift-way of-way singing-way girls.-way Such-way
joy-way they-way gave-way him-way that-way for-way three-way days-way no-way court-way was-way held.-way On-way this-way
Confucius-way left-way the-way land,-way 497-way B.C.-way

For-way the-way next-way thirteen-way years-way Confucius-way wandered-way from-way land-way to-way land,-way
followed-way by-way his-way disciples,-way seeking-way in-way vain-way for-way a-way ruler-way that-way was-way
willing-way to-way employ-way him,-way and-way whom-way he-way was-way willing-way to-way serve.-way At-way times-way he-way
was-way exposed-way to-way danger,-way at-way other-way times-way to-way want.-way But-way as-way a-way rule-way he-way was-way
treated-way with-way consideration,-way although-way his-way teachings-way were-way ignored.-way Yet-way
thirteen-way years-way of-way homeless-way wandering,-way of-way hopes-way deferred-way and-way
frustrated,-way must-way have-way been-way hard-way to-way bear.-way When-way he-way left-way office-way Confucius-way
was-way already-way fifty-three-way years-way old,-way and-way his-way life-way so-way far-way seemed-way a-way
failure.-way The-way sense-way of-way his-way wasted-way powers-way may-way well-way have-way tempted-way him-way now-way
and-way again-way to-way take-way office-way under-way an-way unworthy-way ruler;-way but-way knowing-way that-way no-way
good-way could-way come-way of-way it-way he-way refrained,-way and-way probably-way he-way never-way seriously-way
thought-way of-way doing-way so.-way

In-way 483-way B.C.,-way when-way Confucius-way was-way sixty-six-way years-way old,-way through-way the-way
influence-way of-way his-way disciple-way Jan-way Yu,-way who-way was-way in-way the-way service-way of-way the-way Chi,-way
the-way Master-way was-way invited-way to-way return-way to-way his-way native-way land.-way Here-way he-way remained-way
till-way his-way death-way in-way 479-way B.C.-way He-way had-way many-way interviews-way with-way the-way reigning-way
duke-way and-way the-way head-way of-way the-way Chi-way clan,-way but-way gained-way no-way influence-way over-way either-way
of-way them.-way So-way he-way turned-way once-way more-way to-way his-way favourite-way studies;-way edited-way the-way
_Book-way of-way Poetry_--perhaps-way the-way most-way interesting-way collection-way of-way ancient-way
songs-way extant--and-way wrote-way _Spring-way and-way Autumn_.-way His-way closing-way years-way were-way
darkened-way by-way the-way loss-way of-way those-way dearest-way to-way him.-way First-way his-way son-way died,-way then-way
Yen-way Yüan,-way the-way disciple-way whom-way he-way loved-way best.-way At-way his-way death-way the-way Master-way was-way
overcome-way by-way grief,-way and-way he-way left-way none-way behind-way him-way that-way loved-way learning.-way
Lastly-way Tzu-lu,-way the-way frank-way and-way bold,-way was-way killed-way in-way battle.-way A-way little-way
later,-way in-way his-way seventy-first-way year,-way Confucius-way himself-way passed-way away,-way 479-way
B.C.-way

This-way book-way of-way the-way Master's-way Sayings-way is-way believed-way by-way the-way Chinese-way to-way have-way
been-way written-way by-way the-way disciples-way of-way Confucius.-way But-way there-way is-way nothing-way to-way
prove-way this,-way and-way some-way passages-way in-way the-way book-way point-way the-way other-way way.-way Book-way
viii-way speaks-way of-way the-way death-way of-way Tseng-tzu,-way who-way did-way not-way die-way till-way 437-way B.C.,-way
forty-two-way years-way after-way the-way Master.-way The-way chief-way authority-way for-way the-way text-way as-way
it-way stands-way to-day-way is-way a-way manuscript-way found-way in-way the-way house-way of-way Confucius-way in-way
150-way B.C.,-way hidden-way there,-way in-way all-way likelihood,-way between-way the-way years-way 213-way and-way
211-way B.C.,-way when-way the-way reigning-way emperor-way was-way seeking-way to-way destroy-way every-way copy-way
of-way the-way classics.-way We-way find-way no-way earlier-way reference-way to-way the-way book-way under-way its-way
present-way name.-way But-way Mencius-way (372-289-way B.C.)-way quotes-way seven-way passages-way from-way
it,-way in-way language-way all-way but-way identical-way with-way the-way present-way text,-way as-way the-way words-way
of-way Confucius.-way No-way man-way ever-way talked-way the-way language-way of-way these-way sayings.-way Such-way
pith-way and-way smoothness-way is-way only-way reached-way by-way a-way long-way process-way of-way rounding-way and-way
polishing.-way We-way shall-way probably-way come-way no-way nearer-way to-way the-way truth-way than-way Legge's-way
conclusion-way that-way the-way book-way was-way put-way together-way by-way the-way pupils-way of-way the-way
disciples-way of-way Confucius,-way from-way the-way words-way and-way notebooks-way of-way their-way masters,-way
about-way the-way year-way 400-way B.C.-way

[Footnote-way 30:-way Wang-sun-way Chia-way was-way minister-way of-way Wei,-way and-way had-way more-way

1.-way Of-way Kung-yeh-way Ch'ang-way the-way Master-way said,-way A-way girl-way might-way be-way wedded-way to-way him.-way

3.-way Tzu-kung-way asked,-way And-way what-way of-way me?-way

Thou-way art-way a-way vessel,-way said-way the-way Master.-way

What-way kind-way of-way vessel?-way

A-way rich-way temple-way vessel.-way

4.-way One-way said,-way Yung[39]-way has-way love,-way but-way he-way is-way not-way glib.-way

[Footnote-way 38:-way A-way disciple-way born-way in-way Lu.]-way

[Footnote-way 39:-way The-way disciple-way Chung-kung.]-way

The-way Master-way said,-way What-way is-way the-way good-way of-way being-way glib?-way Fighting-way men-way with-way
tongue-craft-way mostly-way makes-way men-way hate-way you.-way Whether-way love-way be-way his-way I-way do-way not-way
know,-way but-way what-way is-way the-way good-way of-way being-way glib?-way

5.-way The-way Master-way moved-way Ch'i-tiao-way K'ai-way to-way take-way office.-way

He-way answered,-way For-way this-way I-way want-way confidence.-way

The-way Master-way was-way pleased.-way

6.-way The-way Master-way said,-way Forsaken-way is-way the-way Way!-way I-way must-way take-way ship-way and-way stem-way
the-way seas;-way and-way Yu[40]-way shall-way go-way with-way me.-way

When-way Tzu-lu-way heard-way this-way he-way was-way glad.-way

The-way Master-way said,-way Yu-way loves-way daring-way more-way than-way I-way do,-way but-way he-way is-way at-way a-way loss-way
how-way to-way take-way things.-way

7.-way Meng-way Wu-way asked-way whether-way Tzu-lu-way had-way love.-way

I-way do-way not-way know,-way said-way the-way Master.-way

He-way asked-way again.-way

A-way land-way of-way a-way thousand-way chariots-way might-way give-way Yu-way charge-way of-way its-way levies;-way but-way
whether-way love-way be-way his-way I-way do-way not-way know.-way

And-way how-way about-way Ch'iu?[41]-way

A-way town-way of-way a-way thousand-way households,-way a-way clan-way of-way an-way hundred-way chariots-way might-way
make-way Ch'iu-way governor;-way but-way whether-way love-way be-way his-way I-way do-way not-way know.-way

guests;-way but-way whether-way love-way be-way his-way I-way do-way not-way know.-way

8.-way The-way Master-way said-way to-way Tzu-kung,-way Which-way is-way the-way better-way man,-way thou-way or-way
Hui[43]?-way

He-way answered,-way How-way dare-way I-way look-way as-way high-way as-way Hui?-way When-way Hui-way hears-way one-way thing,-way
he-way understands-way ten;-way when-way I-way hear-way one-way thing-way I-way understand-way two.-way

The-way Master-way said,-way Thou-way art-way not-way his-way like.-way Neither-way art-way thou-way his-way like,-way nor-way

[Footnote-way 43:-way The-way disciple-way Yen-way Yüan.]-way

[Footnote-way 44:-way The-way disciple-way Tsai-way Wo.]-way

The-way Master-way said,-way Rotten-way wood-way cannot-way be-way carved,-way nor-way are-way dung-way walls-way
plastered.-way Why-way chide-way with-way Yü?-way

The-way Master-way said,-way When-way I-way first-way met-way men-way I-way listened-way to-way their-way words-way and-way
took-way their-way deeds-way on-way trust.-way When-way I-way meet-way them-way now,-way I-way listen-way to-way their-way

10.-way The-way Master-way said,-way I-way have-way met-way no-way firm-way man.-way

One-way answered,-way Shen-way Ch'ang.-way

The-way Master-way said,-way Ch'ang-way is-way passionate;-way how-way can-way he-way be-way firm?-way

11.-way Tzu-kung-way said,-way What-way I-way do-way not-way wish-way done-way to-way me,-way I-way likewise-way wish-way not-way
to-way do-way to-way others.-way

The-way Master-way said,-way That-way is-way still-way beyond-way thee,-way Tz'u.-way

12.-way Tzu-kung-way said,-way To-way hear-way the-way Master-way on-way his-way art-way and-way precepts-way is-way
granted-way us;-way but-way to-way hear-way him-way on-way man's-way nature-way and-way the-way Way-way of-way Heaven-way is-way
not.-way

13.-way Until-way Tzu-lu-way could-way do-way what-way he-way had-way heard,-way his-way only-way fear-way was-way to-way hear-way
more.-way

14.-way Tzu-kung-way asked,-way Why-way was-way K'ung-wen-way called-way cultured?-way

The-way Master-way said,-way He-way was-way quick-way and-way loved-way learning;-way he-way was-way not-way ashamed-way
to-way ask-way those-way beneath-way him:-way that-way is-way why-way he-way was-way called-way cultured.-way

15.-way The-way Master-way said,-way Of-way the-way ways-way of-way a-way gentleman-way Tzu-ch'an-way had-way four.-way
His-way life-way was-way modest;-way he-way honoured-way those-way that-way he-way served.-way He-way was-way kind-way in-way
feeding-way the-way people,-way and-way he-way was-way just-way in-way his-way calls-way upon-way them.-way

16.-way The-way Master-way said,-way Yen-way P'ing-way was-way a-way good-way friend.-way The-way longer-way he-way knew-way
you,-way the-way more-way attentive-way he-way grew.-way

17.-way The-way Master-way said,-way Tsang-way Wen-way lodged-way his-way tortoise-way with-way hills-way on-way the-way
pillars-way and-way reeds-way on-way the-way uprights:-way was-way this-way his-way wisdom?-way

18.-way Tzu-chang-way said,-way The-way chief-way minister,-way Tzu-wen,-way was-way thrice-way made-way
minister-way without-way showing-way gladness,-way thrice-way he-way left-way office-way with-way unmoved-way
looks.-way He-way always-way told-way the-way new-way ministers-way how-way the-way old-way ones-way had-way governed:-way
how-way was-way that?-way

He-way was-way faithful,-way said-way the-way Master.-way

But-way was-way it-way love?-way

I-way do-way not-way know,-way said-way the-way Master:-way how-way should-way this-way amount-way to-way love?-way

When-way Ts'ui-way murdered-way the-way lord-way of-way Ch'i,-way Ch'en-way Wen-way threw-way up-way ten-way teams-way of-way
horses-way and-way left-way the-way land.-way On-way coming-way to-way another-way kingdom-way he-way said,-way 'Like-way
my-way lord-way Ts'ui,'-way and-way left-way it.-way On-way coming-way to-way a-way second-way kingdom-way he-way said-way
again,-way 'Like-way my-way lord-way Ts'ui,'-way and-way left-way it:-way how-way was-way that?-way

He-way was-way clean,-way said-way the-way Master.-way

But-way was-way it-way love?-way

I-way do-way not-way know,-way said-way the-way Master:-way how-way should-way this-way amount-way to-way love?-way

19.-way Chi-way Wen-way thought-way thrice-way before-way acting.-way

On-way hearing-way this-way the-way Master-way said,-way Twice-way is-way enough.-way

20.-way The-way Master-way said,-way Whilst-way the-way land-way kept-way the-way Way-way Ning-way Wu-way showed-way
wisdom;-way when-way his-way land-way lost-way the-way Way-way he-way grew-way simple.-way His-way wisdom-way we-way may-way
come-way up-way to;-way such-way simplicity-way is-way beyond-way us.[45]-way

the-way seventh-way century-way B.C.-way The-way duke-way was-way driven-way from-way his-way throne-way and-way

stuck-way to-way his-way master-way and-way finally-way effected-way his-way restoration.]-way

21.-way When-way he-way was-way in-way Ch'en-way the-way Master-way said,-way Home,-way I-way must-way go-way home!-way
Zealous,-way or-way rash,-way or-way finished-way scholars,-way my-way young-way sons-way at-way home-way do-way not-way
know-way what-way pruning-way they-way still-way need!-way

22.-way The-way Master-way said,-way Because-way Po-yi-way and-way Shu-ch'i-way never-way remembered-way old-way
wickedness-way they-way made-way few-way enemies.[46]-way

23.-way The-way Master-way said,-way Who-way can-way call-way Wei-sheng-way Kao-way straight?-way A-way man-way begged-way
him-way for-way vinegar:-way he-way begged-way it-way of-way a-way neighbour,-way and-way gave-way it.-way

24.-way The-way Master-way said,-way Smooth-way words,-way fawning-way looks,-way and-way overdone-way
humility,-way Tso-way Ch'iu-ming-way thought-way shameful,-way and-way so-way do-way I.-way He-way thought-way it-way
shameful-way to-way hide-way ill-will-way and-way ape-way friendship,-way and-way so-way do-way I.-way

25.-way As-way Yen-way Yüan-way and-way Chi-lu[47]-way were-way sitting-way with-way him,-way the-way Master-way said,-way
Why-way not-way each-way of-way you-way tell-way me-way thy-way wishes?-way

[Footnote-way 46:-way Po-yi-way and-way Shu-ch'i-way were-way sons-way of-way the-way King-way of-way Ku-chu.-way
Their-way father-way left-way the-way throne-way to-way the-way younger-way of-way the-way two;-way but-way he-way would-way
not-way supplant-way the-way elder,-way nor-way would-way the-way elder-way go-way against-way his-way father's-way

'His-way eyes-way would-way not-way look-way on-way an-way evil-way face,-way his-way ears-way would-way not-way listen-way to-way

he-way dwelt-way by-way the-way North-way Sea-way shore,-way waiting-way for-way all-way below-way heaven-way to-way grow-way

To-way be-way stern-way to-way himself,-way said-way Chung-kung,-way and-way slack-way in-way his-way claims-way on-way

BOOK-way IX-way


1.-way The-way Master-way seldom-way spake-way of-way gain,-way or-way love,-way or-way the-way Bidding.-way

2.-way A-way man-way of-way the-way village-way of-way Ta-hsiang-way said,-way The-way great-way Confucius,-way with-way
his-way vast-way learning,-way has-way made-way no-way name-way in-way anything.-way

When-way the-way Master-way heard-way this,-way he-way said-way to-way his-way disciples,-way What-way shall-way I-way

take-way up-way driving.-way

3.-way The-way Master-way said,-way A-way linen-way cap-way is-way good-way form;-way now-way silk-way is-way worn.-way It-way is-way
cheap,-way so-way I-way follow-way the-way many.-way To-way bow-way below-way is-way good-way form;-way now-way it-way is-way done-way

below.-way

4.-way From-way four-way things-way the-way Master-way was-way quite-way free:-way by-ends-way and-way 'must'-way and-way

Confucius-way resembled-way him,-way and-way the-way men-way of-way K'uang-way set-way upon-way him,-way mistaking-way
him-way for-way their-way enemy.-way The-way commentators-way say-way that-way the-way Master-way was-way not-way

Tzu-kung-way said,-way Heaven-way has,-way indeed,-way given-way him-way so-way much-way that-way he-way is-way almost-way
holy,-way and-way he-way can-way do-way many-way things,-way too.-way

When-way the-way Master-way heard-way this,-way he-way said,-way Does-way the-way minister-way know-way me?-way
Because-way I-way was-way poor-way when-way young,-way I-way can-way do-way many-way paltry-way things.-way But-way does-way
doing-way many-way things-way make-way a-way gentleman?-way No,-way not-way doing-way many-way does.-way

Lao-way said,-way The-way Master-way would-way say,-way As-way I-way had-way no-way post-way I-way learned-way the-way crafts.-way

7.-way The-way Master-way said,-way Have-way I-way in-way truth-way wisdom?-way I-way have-way no-way wisdom.-way But-way when-way

deeper-way as-way I-way dig!-way I-way catch-way sight-way of-way it-way ahead,-way and-way on-way a-way sudden-way it-way is-way

not-way until-way my-way strength-way were-way spent.-way What-way seems-way the-way mark-way stands-way near;-way but-way

11.-way When-way the-way Master-way was-way very-way ill,-way Tzu-lu-way made-way the-way disciples-way act-way as-way

This-way show-way of-way ministers,-way when-way I-way have-way no-way ministers,-way whom-way will-way it-way take-way
in?-way Will-way Heaven-way be-way taken-way in?-way And-way is-way it-way not-way better-way to-way die-way in-way the-way arms-way
of-way my-way two-three-way boys-way than-way to-way die-way in-way the-way arms-way of-way ministers?-way And,-way if-way I-way
miss-way a-way big-way burial,-way shall-way I-way die-way by-way the-way roadside?-way

12.-way Tzu-kung-way said,-way If-way I-way had-way here-way a-way fair-way piece-way of-way jade,-way should-way I-way hide-way
it-way away-way in-way a-way case,-way or-way seek-way a-way good-way price-way and-way sell-way it?-way

Sell-way it,-way sell-way it!-way said-way the-way Master.-way I-way tarry-way for-way my-way price.-way

13.-way The-way Master-way wished-way to-way dwell-way among-way the-way nine-way tribes.[85]-way

[Footnote-way 85:-way In-way the-way east-way of-way Shantung.]-way

14.-way The-way Master-way said.-way After-way I-way came-way back-way from-way Wei-way to-way Lu-way the-way music-way was-way

15.-way The-way Master-way said,-way To-way serve-way dukes-way and-way ministers-way abroad-way and-way father-way

23.-way The-way Master-way said,-way Who-way would-way not-way give-way ear-way to-way a-way downright-way word?-way But-way
to-way mend-way is-way better.-way Who-way would-way not-way be-way pleased-way by-way a-way guiding-way word?-way But-way to-way

6.-way Tzu-chang-way asked,-way What-way is-way insight?-way

The-way Master-way said,-way Not-way to-way be-way moved-way by-way lap-way and-way wash-way of-way slander,-way or-way by-way

Food,-way said-way the-way Master.-way From-way of-way old-way all-way men-way die,-way but-way without-way trust-way a-way

8.-way Chi-way Tzu-ch'eng[117]-way said,-way It-way is-way the-way stuff-way alone-way that-way makes-way a-way

Alas!-way my-way lord,-way said-way Tzu-kung,-way how-way ye-way speak-way of-way a-way gentleman!-way No-way team-way

no-way less-way than-way the-way art.-way Without-way the-way fur,-way a-way tiger-way or-way a-way leopard's-way hide-way is-way

10.-way Tzu-chang-way asked-way how-way to-way raise-way the-way mind-way and-way scatter-way delusions.-way

The-way Master-way said,-way Put-way faithfulness-way and-way truth-way first,-way and-way follow-way the-way

to-way what-way we-way hate.-way To-way wish-way it-way both-way life-way and-way death-way is-way a-way delusion.-way

father-way to-way be-way father-way and-way the-way son,-way son.-way

True-way indeed!-way said-way the-way Duke.-way If-way the-way lord-way were-way no-way lord-way and-way the-way liege-way no-way
liege,-way the-way father-way no-way father-way and-way the-way son-way no-way son,-way though-way the-way grain-way were-way

12.-way The-way Master-way said,-way To-way stint-way a-way quarrel-way with-way half-way a-way word-way Yu[120]-way is-way
the-way man.-way

Tzu-lu-way never-way slept-way over-way a-way promise.-way

13.-way The-way Master-way said,-way At-way hearing-way lawsuits-way I-way am-way no-way better-way than-way others.-way

The-way Master-way said,-way To-way be-way tireless-way of-way thought-way and-way faithful-way in-way doing.-way

15.-way The-way Master-way said,-way Breadth-way of-way reading-way and-way the-way ties-way of-way courtesy-way will-way

16.-way The-way Master-way said,-way A-way gentleman-way shapes-way the-way good-way in-way man,-way he-way does-way not-way
shape-way the-way bad-way in-way him.-way The-way small-way man-way does-way the-way contrary.-way

17.-way Chi-way K'ang[121]-way asked-way Confucius-way how-way to-way rule.-way

lead,-way Sir,-way who-way will-way dare-way not-way go-way straight?-way

[Footnote-way 119:-way Confucius-way was-way in-way Ch'i-way in-way 517-way B.C.-way The-way duke-way was-way

Confucius-way answered,-way Sir,-way what-way need-way has-way a-way ruler-way to-way kill?-way If-way ye-way wished-way

The-way Master-way said,-way What-way dost-way thou-way mean-way by-way eminence?-way

Tzu-chang-way answered,-way To-way be-way famous-way in-way the-way state-way and-way famous-way in-way his-way home.-way

That-way is-way fame,-way not-way eminence,-way said-way the-way Master.-way The-way eminent-way man-way is-way plain-way

the-way mind-way be-way raised?-way Fight-way the-way bad-way in-way thee,-way not-way the-way bad-way in-way other-way men,-way
will-way not-way evil-way be-way mended?-way One-way angry-way morning-way to-way forget-way both-way self-way and-way

22.-way Fan-way Ch'ih-way asked,-way What-way is-way love?-way

1.-way Tzu-lu-way asked-way how-way to-way rule.-way

2.-way When-way he-way was-way steward-way of-way the-way Chi,-way Chung-kung-way asked-way how-way to-way rule.-way

The-way Master-way said,-way Let-way officers-way act-way first;-way overlook-way small-way faults,-way lift-way
up-way brains-way and-way worth.-way

Chung-kung-way said,-way How-way shall-way I-way get-way to-way know-way brains-way and-way worth-way to-way lift-way them-way
up?-way

Lift-way up-way those-way thou-way dost-way know,-way said-way the-way Master;-way and-way those-way thou-way dost-way not-way

3.-way Tzu-lu-way said,-way The-way lord-way of-way Wei[125]-way waits-way for-way you,-way Sir,-way to-way govern.-way
How-way shall-way ye-way begin?-way

Surely,-way said-way the-way Master,-way by-way putting-way names-way right.-way

Indeed,-way said-way Tzu-lu,-way that-way is-way far-fetched,-way Sir.-way Why-way put-way them-way right?-way

What-way a-way savage-way Yu[126]-way is!-way said-way the-way Master.-way A-way gentleman-way is-way tongue-tied-way
when-way he-way does-way not-way understand.-way If-way names-way are-way not-way right,-way words-way do-way not-way fit.-way
If-way words-way do-way not-way fit,-way affairs-way go-way wrong.-way If-way affairs-way go-way wrong,-way neither-way
courtesy-way nor-way music-way thrive.-way If-way courtesy-way and-way music-way do-way not-way thrive,-way law-way
and-way justice-way fail.-way And-way if-way law-way and-way justice-way fail-way them,-way the-way people-way can-way
move-way neither-way hand-way nor-way foot.-way So-way a-way gentleman-way must-way be-way ready-way to-way put-way names-way
into-way speech-way and-way words-way into-way deed.-way A-way gentleman-way is-way nowise-way careless-way of-way his-way
words.-way

4.-way Fan-way Ch'ih-way asked-way to-way be-way taught-way husbandry.-way

The-way Master-way said.-way An-way old-way husbandman-way knows-way more-way than-way I-way do.-way

He-way asked-way to-way be-way taught-way gardening.-way

The-way Master-way said.-way An-way old-way gardener-way knows-way more-way than-way I-way do.-way

After-way Fan-way Ch'ih-way had-way gone,-way the-way Master-way said,-way How-way small-way a-way man!-way If-way those-way
above-way love-way courtesy,-way no-way one-way will-way dare-way to-way slight-way them;-way if-way they-way love-way
right,-way no-way one-way will-way dare-way to-way disobey;-way if-way they-way love-way truth,-way no-way one-way will-way
dare-way to-way hide-way the-way heart.-way Then,-way from-way the-way four-way corners-way of-way the-way earth,-way folk-way
will-way gather-way with-way their-way children-way on-way their-way backs;-way and-way what-way need-way will-way
there-way be-way for-way husbandry?-way

5.-way The-way Master-way said,-way Though-way a-way man-way have-way conned-way three-way hundred-way poems,-way if-way
he-way stands-way helpless-way when-way put-way to-way govern,-way if-way he-way cannot-way answer-way for-way himself-way
when-way he-way is-way sent-way to-way the-way four-way corners-way of-way the-way earth,-way many-way as-way they-way are,-way
what-way have-way they-way done-way for-way him?-way

6.-way The-way Master-way said,-way The-way man-way of-way upright-way life-way is-way obeyed-way before-way he-way
speaks;-way commands-way even-way go-way unheeded-way when-way the-way life-way is-way crooked.-way

7.-way The-way Master-way said,-way The-way governments-way of-way Lu-way and-way Wei-way are-way brothers.-way

8.-way Speaking-way of-way Ching,-way of-way the-way ducal-way house-way of-way Wei,-way the-way Master-way said,-way He-way
was-way wise-way in-way his-way private-way life.-way When-way he-way had-way begun-way to-way save,-way he-way said,-way This-way
seems-way enough.-way When-way he-way grew-way better-way off,-way he-way said,-way This-way seems-way plenty.-way
When-way he-way had-way grown-way rich,-way he-way said.-way This-way seems-way splendour.-way

9.-way When-way Jan-way Yu-way was-way driving-way him-way to-way Wei,-way the-way Master-way said.-way What-way numbers!-way

Jan-way Yu-way said,-way Since-way numbers-way are-way here,-way what-way next-way is-way needed?-way

Wealth,-way said-way the-way Master.-way

And-way what-way comes-way next-way after-way wealth?-way

Teaching,-way said-way the-way Master.-way

10.-way The-way Master-way said,-way If-way I-way were-way employed-way for-way a-way twelve-month,-way much-way could-way

11.-way The-way Master-way said,-way If-way good-way men-way were-way to-way govern-way a-way land-way for-way an-way hundred-way
years,-way cruelty-way would-way be-way conquered-way and-way putting-way to-way death-way done-way away-way with.-way
How-way true-way are-way these-way words!-way

12.-way The-way Master-way said,-way Even-way if-way a-way king-way were-way to-way govern,-way a-way lifetime-way would-way
pass-way before-way love-way dawned!-way

13.-way The-way Master-way said,-way What-way is-way governing-way to-way a-way man-way that-way can-way rule-way himself?-way
If-way he-way cannot-way rule-way himself,-way how-way shall-way he-way rule-way others?-way

14.-way As-way the-way disciple-way Jan[127]-way came-way back-way from-way court,-way the-way Master-way said-way to-way
him.-way Why-way so-way late?-way

I-way had-way business-way of-way state,-way he-way answered.-way

Household-way business,-way said-way the-way Master.-way If-way it-way had-way been-way business-way of-way state,-way
though-way I-way am-way out-way of-way office,-way I-way should-way have-way heard-way of-way it.-way

15.-way Duke-way Ting-way asked,-way Is-way there-way any-way one-way saying-way that-way can-way bless-way a-way kingdom?-way

[Footnote-way 127:-way Jan-way Yu.-way He-way was-way in-way the-way service-way of-way the-way Chi,-way not-way of-way the-way
Duke-way of-way Lu.]-way

Confucius-way answered,-way That-way is-way more-way than-way words-way can-way do.-way But-way men-way have-way a-way
saying,-way To-way be-way lord-way is-way hard-way and-way to-way be-way minister-way is-way not-way easy.-way And-way if-way one-way
knew-way how-way hard-way it-way is-way to-way be-way lord,-way might-way not-way this-way one-way saying-way almost-way bless-way
a-way kingdom?-way

And-way is-way there-way any-way one-way saying-way that-way can-way wreck-way a-way kingdom?-way

That-way is-way more-way than-way words-way can-way do,-way Confucius-way answered.-way But-way men-way have-way a-way
saying,-way My-way only-way delight-way in-way being-way lord-way is-way that-way no-way one-way withstands-way what-way I-way
say.-way Now-way if-way what-way he-way says-way is-way good,-way and-way no-way one-way withstands-way him,-way is-way not-way
that-way good-way too?-way But-way if-way it-way is-way not-way good,-way and-way no-way one-way withstands-way him,-way might-way
not-way this-way one-way saying-way almost-way wreck-way a-way kingdom?-way

16.-way The-way Duke-way of-way She-way asked,-way What-way is-way kingcraft?-way

The-way Master-way answered,-way For-way those-way near-way us-way to-way be-way happy-way and-way those-way far-way off-way
to-way come.-way

17.-way When-way he-way was-way governor-way of-way Chü-fu,-way Tzu-hsia-way asked-way how-way to-way rule.-way

The-way Master-way said,-way Be-way not-way eager-way for-way haste;-way look-way not-way for-way small-way gains.-way
Nothing-way done-way in-way haste-way is-way thorough,-way and-way looking-way for-way small-way gains-way big-way
things-way are-way left-way undone.-way

18.-way The-way Duke-way of-way She-way told-way Confucius,-way Among-way the-way upright-way men-way of-way my-way clan-way
if-way the-way father-way steals-way a-way sheep-way his-way son-way bears-way witness.-way

Confucius-way answered,-way Our-way clan's-way uprightness-way is-way unlike-way that.-way The-way father-way
screens-way his-way son-way and-way the-way son-way screens-way his-way father.-way There-way is-way uprightness-way
in-way this.-way

19.-way Fan-way Ch'ih-way asked,-way What-way is-way love?-way

The-way Master-way said,-way To-way be-way humble-way at-way home,-way earnest-way at-way work,-way and-way faithful-way
to-way all.-way Even-way among-way wild-way tribes-way none-way of-way this-way must-way be-way dropped.-way

20.-way Tzu-kung-way asked,-way What-way is-way it-way that-way we-way call-way knighthood?-way

The-way Master-way said,-way To-way be-way called-way a-way knight,-way a-way man-way must-way be-way shamefast-way in-way all-way
that-way he-way does,-way if-way he-way is-way sent-way to-way the-way four-way corners-way of-way the-way earth-way he-way must-way
not-way disgrace-way his-way lord's-way commands.-way

May-way I-way ask-way who-way would-way come-way next?-way

He-way that-way his-way clansmen-way call-way a-way good-way son-way and-way his-way neighbours-way call-way modest.-way

And-way who-way would-way come-way next?-way

A-way man-way that-way clings-way to-way his-way word-way and-way sticks-way to-way his-way course,-way a-way flinty-way
little-way fellow,-way would-way perhaps-way come-way next.-way

And-way how-way are-way the-way crown-way servants-way of-way to-day?-way

What!-way The-way weights-way and-way measures-way men!-way said-way the-way Master.-way Are-way they-way worth-way
reckoning?-way

21.-way The-way Master-way said,-way As-way I-way cannot-way get-way men-way of-way the-way middle-way way-way I-way have-way to-way
fall-way back-way on-way zealous-way and-way austere-way men.-way Zealous-way men-way push-way ahead-way and-way take-way
things-way up,-way and-way there-way are-way things-way that-way austere-way men-way will-way not-way do.-way

22.-way The-way Master-way said,-way The-way men-way of-way the-way south-way have-way a-way saying,-way 'Unless-way he-way is-way

'His-way instability-way of-way mind-way may-way disgrace-way him.'-way

The-way Master-way said,-way Neglect-way of-way the-way omens,-way that-way is-way all.-way

23.-way The-way Master-way said,-way Gentlemen-way unite,-way but-way are-way not-way the-way same.-way Small-way men-way
are-way all-way the-way same,-way but-way each-way for-way himself.-way

24.-way Tzu-kung-way said,-way If-way the-way whole-way countryside-way loved-way a-way man,-way how-way would-way
that-way be?-way

It-way would-way not-way do,-way said-way the-way Master.-way

And-way how-way would-way it-way be,-way if-way the-way whole-way countryside-way hated-way him?-way

It-way would-way not-way do,-way said-way the-way Master.-way It-way would-way be-way better-way if-way all-way the-way good-way
men-way of-way the-way countryside-way loved-way him-way and-way all-way the-way bad-way men-way hated-way him.-way

25.-way The-way Master-way said,-way A-way gentleman-way is-way easy-way to-way serve-way and-way hard-way to-way please.-way
If-way we-way go-way from-way the-way Way-way to-way please-way him,-way he-way is-way not-way pleased;-way but-way his-way
commands-way are-way measured-way to-way the-way man.-way A-way small-way man-way is-way hard-way to-way serve-way and-way
easy-way to-way please.-way Though-way we-way go-way from-way the-way Way-way to-way please-way him,-way he-way is-way
pleased;-way but-way he-way expects-way everything-way of-way his-way men.-way

26.-way The-way Master-way said,-way A-way gentleman-way is-way high-minded,-way not-way proud;-way the-way small-way
man-way is-way proud,-way but-way not-way high-minded.-way

27.-way The-way Master-way said,-way Strength-way and-way courage,-way simplicity-way and-way modesty-way are-way

28.-way Tzu-lu-way asked,-way When-way can-way a-way man-way be-way called-way a-way knight?-way

29.-way The-way Master-way said,-way If-way a-way good-way man-way taught-way the-way people-way for-way seven-way years,-way

1.-way Hsien[128]-way asked,-way What-way is-way shame?-way

The-way Master-way said,-way To-way draw-way pay-way when-way the-way land-way keeps-way the-way Way-way and-way to-way draw-way
pay-way when-way it-way has-way lost-way the-way Way,-way is-way shame.-way

2.-way To-way eschew-way strife-way and-way bragging,-way spite-way and-way greed,-way would-way that-way be-way love?-way

The-way Master-way said,-way That-way may-way be-way hard-way to-way do;-way but-way I-way do-way not-way know-way that-way it-way is-way
love.-way

3.-way The-way Master-way said,-way A-way knight-way that-way is-way fond-way of-way ease-way does-way not-way amount-way to-way a-way
knight.-way

4.-way The-way Master-way said,-way Whilst-way the-way land-way keeps-way the-way Way,-way be-way fearless-way of-way
speech-way and-way fearless-way in-way deed;-way when-way the-way land-way has-way lost-way the-way Way,-way be-way
fearless-way in-way deed-way but-way soft-way of-way speech.-way

5.-way The-way Master-way said,-way A-way man-way of-way mind-way can-way always-way talk,-way but-way talkers-way are-way not-way
always-way men-way of-way mind.-way Love-way is-way always-way bold,-way though-way boldness-way is-way found-way
without-way love.-way

6.-way Nan-kung-way Kuo-way said-way to-way Confucius,-way Yi[129]-way shot-way well,-way Ao-way pushed-way a-way boat-way
over-way land:-way each-way died-way before-way his-way time.-way Yü-way and-way Chi-way toiled-way at-way their-way
crops,-way and-way had-way all-way below-way heaven.-way

The-way Master-way did-way not-way answer.-way But-way when-way Nan-kung-way Kuo-way had-way gone,-way he-way said,-way
What-way a-way gentleman-way he-way is!-way How-way he-way honours-way mind!-way

[Footnote-way 128:-way The-way disciple-way Yüan-way Ssu.]-way

[Footnote-way 129:-way Yi-way was-way killed-way by-way his-way best-way pupil,-way who-way said-way to-way himself,-way
In-way all-way the-way world-way no-way one-way but-way Yi-way shoots-way better-way than-way I-way do.-way So-way he-way killed-way
him.]-way

7.-way The-way Master-way said,-way Alas!-way there-way have-way been-way gentlemen-way without-way love!-way But-way
there-way has-way never-way been-way a-way small-way man-way that-way was-way not-way wanting-way in-way love.-way

8.-way The-way Master-way said,-way Can-way he-way love-way thee-way that-way never-way tasks-way thee?-way Can-way he-way be-way
faithful-way that-way never-way chides?-way

9.-way The-way Master-way said,-way The-way decrees-way were-way drafted-way by-way P'i-way Shen,-way criticised-way
by-way Shih-shu,-way polished-way by-way the-way Foreign-way Minister-way Tzu-yü,-way and-way given-way the-way
final-way touches-way by-way Tzu-ch'an-way of-way Tung-li.-way

10.-way When-way he-way was-way asked-way what-way he-way thought-way of-way Tzu-ch'an,-way the-way Master-way said,-way A-way
kind-hearted-way man.-way

Asked-way what-way he-way thought-way of-way Tzu-hsi,-way the-way Master-way said,-way Of-way him!-way What-way I-way
think-way of-way him!-way

Asked-way what-way he-way thought-way of-way Kuan-way Chung,[130]-way the-way Master-way said,-way He-way was-way the-way
man-way that-way drove-way the-way Po-way from-way the-way town-way of-way Pien-way with-way its-way three-way hundred-way
households-way to-way end-way his-way days-way on-way coarse-way rice,-way without-way his-way muttering-way a-way
word.-way

[Footnote-way 130:-way See-way note-way to-way Book-way III,-way §-way 22.]-way

11.-way The-way Master-way said,-way Not-way to-way grumble-way at-way being-way poor-way is-way hard,-way not-way to-way be-way
proud-way of-way wealth-way is-way easy.-way

12.-way The-way Master-way said,-way Meng-way Kung-ch'o-way is-way more-way than-way fit-way to-way be-way steward-way of-way
Chao-way or-way Wei,-way but-way he-way could-way not-way be-way minister-way of-way T'eng-way or-way Hsieh.-way

13.-way Tzu-lu-way asked-way what-way would-way make-way a-way full-grown-way man.-way

The-way Master-way said,-way The-way wisdom-way of-way Tsang-way Wu-chung,-way Kung-ch'o's-way lack-way of-way
greed,-way Chuang-way of-way Pien's-way boldness-way and-way the-way skill-way of-way Jan-way Ch'iu,-way graced-way by-way
courtesy-way and-way music,-way might-way make-way a-way full-grown-way man.-way

But-way now,-way he-way said,-way who-way asks-way the-way like-way of-way a-way full-grown-way man?-way He-way that-way in-way
sight-way of-way gain-way thinks-way of-way right,-way who-way when-way danger-way looms-way stakes-way his-way life,-way
who,-way though-way the-way bond-way be-way old,-way does-way not-way forget-way what-way he-way has-way been-way saying-way
all-way his-way life,-way might-way make-way a-way full-grown-way man.-way

14.-way Speaking-way of-way Kung-shu-way Wen,-way the-way Master-way said-way to-way Kung-ming-way Chia,-way Is-way it-way
true-way that-way thy-way master-way does-way not-way speak,-way nor-way laugh,-way nor-way take-way a-way gift?-way

Kung-ming-way Chia-way answered,-way That-way is-way saying-way too-way much.-way My-way master-way only-way
speaks-way when-way the-way time-way comes,-way so-way no-way one-way tires-way of-way his-way speaking;-way he-way only-way
laughs-way when-way he-way is-way merry,-way so-way no-way one-way tires-way of-way his-way laughter;-way he-way only-way
takes-way when-way it-way is-way right-way to-way take,-way so-way no-way one-way tires-way of-way his-way taking.-way

It-way may-way be-way so,-way said-way the-way Master;-way but-way is-way it?-way

15.-way The-way Master-way said,-way When-way he-way held-way Fang-way and-way asked-way Lu-way to-way appoint-way an-way
heir,-way though-way Tsang-way Wu-chung-way said-way he-way was-way not-way forcing-way his-way lord,-way I-way do-way not-way
believe-way it.-way

16.-way The-way Master-way said,-way Duke-way Wen-way of-way Chin-way was-way deep,-way but-way dishonest;-way Duke-way
Huan-way of-way Ch'i-way was-way honest,-way but-way shallow.-way

17.-way Tzu-lu-way said,-way When-way Duke-way Huan-way slew-way the-way young-way duke-way Chiu,-way and-way Shao-way Hu-way
died-way with-way him,-way but-way Kuan-way Chung-way did-way not,-way was-way not-way this-way want-way of-way love?[131]-way

[Footnote-way 131:-way Chiu-way and-way Huan-way were-way brothers,-way sons-way of-way the-way Duke-way of-way Ch'i.-way
When-way their-way father-way died,-way their-way uncle-way seized-way the-way throne.-way To-way preserve-way the-way

Huan-way returned-way to-way Ch'i-way and-way secured-way the-way throne.-way He-way then-way required-way the-way
Duke-way of-way Lu-way to-way kill-way his-way brother-way and-way deliver-way up-way to-way him-way Shao-way Hu-way and-way Kuan-way
Chung.-way This-way was-way done.-way But-way on-way the-way way-way to-way Ch'i-way Shao-way Hu-way killed-way himself.-way

his-way chief-way minister,-way and-way raised-way the-way state-way to-way greatness.-way (See-way note-way to-way
Book-way III,-way §-way 22.)]-way

The-way Master-way said,-way Duke-way Huan-way gathered-way the-way great-way vassals-way round-way him,-way not-way
by-way chariots-way of-way war,-way but-way through-way the-way might-way of-way Kuan-way Chung.-way What-way can-way love-way
do-way more?-way What-way can-way love-way do-way more?-way

18.-way Tzu-kung-way said,-way When-way Duke-way Huan-way slew-way the-way young-way duke-way Chiu,-way and-way Kuan-way
Chung-way could-way not-way face-way death-way and-way even-way became-way his-way minister,-way surely-way he-way
showed-way want-way of-way love?-way

The-way Master-way said,-way By-way Kuan-way Chung-way helping-way Duke-way Huan-way to-way put-way down-way the-way great-way
vassals-way and-way make-way all-way below-way heaven-way one,-way men-way have-way fared-way the-way better-way from-way
that-way day-way to-way this.-way But-way for-way Kuan-way Chung-way our-way hair-way would-way hang-way down-way our-way

bumpkin-way and-way his-way lass,-way their-way troth-way to-way keep,-way have-way drowned-way in-way a-way ditch,-way
unknown-way to-way anyone?-way

19.-way The-way minister-way Hsien,-way who-way had-way been-way steward-way to-way Kung-shu-way Wen,-way went-way to-way
audience-way of-way the-way Duke-way together-way with-way Wen.-way

(well-bred).-way

20.-way The-way Master-way spake-way of-way Ling-way Duke-way of-way Wei's-way contempt-way for-way the-way Way.-way

K'ang[132]-way said,-way If-way this-way be-way so,-way how-way does-way he-way escape-way ruin?-way

Confucius-way answered,-way With-way Chung-shu-way Yü-way in-way charge-way of-way the-way guests,-way the-way
reader-way T'o-way in-way charge-way of-way the-way Ancestral-way Temple,-way and-way Wang-sun-way Chia-way in-way

22.-way Ch'en-way Ch'eng-way murdered-way Duke-way Chien.[133]-way

Heng-way has-way murdered-way his-way lord:-way pray,-way punish-way him.-way

28.-way Tseng-tzu-way said,-way Even-way in-way his-way thoughts,-way a-way gentleman-way does-way not-way outstep-way
his-way place.-way

29.-way The-way Master-way said,-way A-way gentleman-way is-way shamefast-way of-way speech:-way his-way deeds-way go-way

30.-way The-way Master-way said,-way In-way the-way way-way of-way the-way gentleman-way there-way are-way three-way

to-way roost-way on,-way Ch'iu,-way unless-way by-way wagging-way a-way glib-way tongue?-way

Confucius-way answered,-way I-way dare-way not-way wag-way a-way glib-way tongue;-way but-way I-way hate-way

35.-way The-way Master-way said,-way A-way steed-way is-way not-way praised-way for-way his-way strength,-way but-way

BOOK-way XVI-way


1.-way The-way Chi-way was-way about-way to-way make-way war-way on-way Chuan-yü.[141]-way

When-way Confucius-way saw-way Jan-way Yu-way and-way Chi-lu,[142]-way they-way said-way to-way him,-way The-way Chi-way
is-way going-way to-way deal-way with-way Chuan-yü.-way

Confucius-way said,-way After-way all,-way Ch'iu,[143]-way art-way thou-way not-way in-way the-way wrong?-way The-way
kings-way of-way old-way made-way Chuan-yü-way lord-way of-way Tung-way Meng.[144]-way Moreover,-way as-way
Chuan-yü-way is-way inside-way our-way borders-way it-way is-way the-way liege-way of-way the-way spirits-way of-way earth-way
and-way corn-way of-way our-way land;-way so-way how-way can-way ye-way make-way war-way upon-way it?-way

Jan-way Yu-way said,-way Our-way master-way wishes-way it.-way Tzu-lu-way and-way I,-way his-way two-way ministers,-way do-way
not,-way either-way of-way us,-way wish-way it.-way

Confucius-way said,-way Ch'iu,-way Chou-way Jen-way used-way to-way say,-way 'He-way that-way can-way put-way forth-way
his-way strength-way takes-way his-way place-way in-way the-way line;-way he-way that-way cannot-way stands-way back.'-way
Who-way would-way take-way to-way help-way him-way a-way man-way that-way is-way no-way stay-way in-way danger-way and-way no-way
support-way in-way falling?-way Moreover,-way what-way thou-way sayest-way is-way wrong.-way If-way a-way tiger-way or-way
a-way buffalo-way escapes-way from-way his-way pen,-way if-way tortoiseshell-way or-way jade-way is-way broken-way in-way
its-way case,-way who-way is-way to-way blame?-way

Jan-way Yu-way said,-way But-way Chuan-yü-way is-way now-way strong,-way and-way it-way is-way near-way to-way Pi[145];-way if-way
it-way is-way not-way taken-way now,-way in-way days-way to-way come-way it-way will-way bring-way sorrow-way on-way our-way sons-way
and-way grandsons.-way

[Footnote-way 141:-way A-way small-way feudatory-way state-way of-way Lu.]-way

[Footnote-way 142:-way Tzu-lu.-way He-way and-way Jan-way Yu-way were-way in-way the-way service-way of-way the-way Chi.]-way

[Footnote-way 143:-way Jan-way Yu.]-way

[Footnote-way 144:-way A-way mountain-way in-way Chuan-yü.-way Since-way the-way Emperor-way had-way given-way the-way
ruler-way of-way Chuan-yü-way the-way right-way to-way sacrifice-way to-way its-way mountains,-way that-way state-way
had-way some-way measure-way of-way independence,-way though-way it-way was-way feudatory-way to-way Lu,-way and-way
within-way its-way borders.]-way

[Footnote-way 145:-way A-way town-way belonging-way to-way the-way Chi.]-way

Ch'iu,-way said-way Confucius,-way instead-way of-way saying-way 'I-way want-way it,'-way a-way gentleman-way
hates-way to-way plead-way that-way he-way needs-way must.-way I-way have-way heard-way that-way fewness-way of-way men-way
does-way not-way vex-way a-way king-way or-way a-way chief,-way but-way unlikeness-way of-way lot-way vexes-way him.-way
Poverty-way does-way not-way vex-way him,-way but-way want-way of-way peace-way vexes-way him.-way For-way if-way wealth-way
were-way even,-way no-way one-way would-way be-way poor.-way In-way harmony-way is-way number;-way peace-way prevents-way
a-way fall.-way Thus,-way if-way far-way off-way tribes-way will-way not-way submit,-way bring-way them-way in-way by-way
encouraging-way mind-way and-way art,-way and-way when-way they-way come-way in-way give-way them-way peace.-way But-way
now,-way when-way far-way off-way tribes-way will-way not-way submit,-way ye-way two,-way helpers-way of-way your-way
lord,-way cannot-way bring-way them-way in.-way The-way kingdom-way is-way split-way and-way falling,-way and-way ye-way
cannot-way save-way it.-way Yet-way inside-way our-way land-way ye-way plot-way to-way move-way spear-way and-way shield!-way
The-way sorrows-way of-way Chi's-way grandsons-way will-way not-way rise-way in-way Chuan-yü,-way I-way fear:-way they-way
will-way rise-way within-way the-way palace-way wall.-way

2.-way Confucius-way said,-way When-way the-way Way-way is-way kept-way below-way heaven,-way courtesy,-way music-way
and-way punitive-way wars-way flow-way from-way the-way Son-way of-way heaven.-way When-way the-way Way-way is-way lost-way
below-way heaven,-way courtesy,-way music-way and-way punitive-way wars-way flow-way from-way the-way great-way
vassals.-way When-way they-way flow-way from-way the-way great-way vassals-way they-way will-way rarely-way last-way
for-way ten-way generations.-way When-way they-way flow-way from-way the-way great-way ministers-way they-way will-way
rarely-way last-way for-way five-way generations.-way When-way underlings-way sway-way the-way country's-way
fate-way they-way will-way rarely-way last-way for-way three-way generations.-way When-way the-way Way-way is-way kept-way
below-way heaven-way power-way does-way not-way lie-way with-way the-way great-way ministers.-way When-way the-way Way-way
is-way kept-way below-way heaven-way common-way folk-way do-way not-way argue.-way

3.-way Confucius-way said,-way For-way five-way generations-way its-way income-way has-way passed-way from-way the-way
ducal-way house;[146]-way for-way four-way generations-way power-way has-way lain-way with-way the-way great-way
ministers:-way and-way humbled,-way therefore,-way are-way the-way sons-way and-way grandsons-way of-way the-way
three-way Huan.-way

[Footnote-way 146:-way Of-way Lu.]-way

4.-way Confucius-way said,-way There-way are-way three-way friends-way that-way help-way us,-way and-way three-way
that-way do-way us-way harm.-way The-way friends-way that-way help-way us-way are-way a-way straight-way friend,-way an-way
outspoken-way friend,-way and-way a-way friend-way that-way has-way heard-way much.-way The-way friends-way that-way
harm-way us-way are-way plausible-way friends,-way friends-way that-way like-way to-way flatter,-way and-way
friends-way with-way a-way glib-way tongue.-way

5.-way Confucius-way said,-way There-way are-way three-way delights-way that-way do-way good,-way and-way three-way
that-way do-way us-way harm.-way Those-way that-way do-way good-way are-way delight-way in-way dissecting-way good-way
form-way and-way music,-way delight-way in-way speaking-way of-way the-way good-way in-way men,-way and-way delight-way in-way
having-way many-way worthy-way friends.-way Those-way that-way do-way harm-way are-way proud-way delights,-way
delight-way in-way idle-way roving,-way and-way delight-way in-way the-way joys-way of-way the-way feast.-way

6.-way Confucius-way said.-way Men-way that-way wait-way upon-way lords-way fall-way into-way three-way mistakes.-way
To-way speak-way before-way the-way time-way has-way come-way is-way rashness.-way Not-way to-way speak-way when-way the-way
time-way has-way come-way is-way secrecy.-way To-way speak-way heedless-way of-way looks-way is-way blindness.-way

7.-way Confucius-way said,-way A-way gentleman-way has-way three-way things-way to-way guard-way against.-way

In-way the-way days-way of-way thy-way youth,-way ere-way thy-way strength-way is-way steady,-way beware-way of-way lust.-way
When-way manhood-way is-way reached,-way in-way the-way fulness-way of-way strength,-way beware-way of-way strife.-way
In-way old-way age,-way when-way thy-way strength-way is-way broken,-way beware-way of-way greed.-way

8.-way Confucius-way said,-way A-way gentleman-way holds-way three-way things-way in-way awe.-way He-way is-way in-way
awe-way of-way the-way Bidding-way of-way Heaven;-way he-way is-way in-way awe-way of-way great-way men;-way and-way he-way is-way
awed-way by-way the-way words-way of-way the-way holy.-way

The-way small-way man-way knows-way not-way the-way Bidding-way of-way Heaven,-way and-way holds-way it-way not-way in-way
awe.-way He-way is-way saucy-way towards-way the-way great;-way he-way makes-way game-way of-way holy-way men's-way words.-way

9.-way Confucius-way said,-way The-way best-way men-way are-way born-way wise.-way Next-way come-way those-way that-way
grow-way wise-way by-way learning;-way then-way those-way that-way learn-way from-way toil.-way Those-way that-way do-way
not-way learn-way from-way toil-way are-way the-way lowest-way of-way the-way people.-way

10.-way Confucius-way said,-way A-way gentleman-way has-way nine-way aims.-way To-way see-way clearly;-way to-way
understand-way what-way he-way hears;-way to-way be-way warm-way in-way manner,-way dignified-way in-way bearing,-way
faithful-way of-way speech,-way keen-way at-way work;-way to-way ask-way when-way in-way doubt;-way in-way anger-way to-way
think-way of-way difficulties;-way and-way in-way sight-way of-way gain-way to-way think-way of-way right.-way

11.-way Confucius-way said,-way In-way sight-way of-way good-way to-way be-way filled-way with-way longing;-way to-way
look-way on-way evil-way as-way scalding-way to-way the-way touch:-way I-way have-way seen-way such-way men,-way I-way have-way
heard-way such-way words.-way

To-way live-way apart-way and-way search-way thy-way will;-way to-way achieve-way thy-way Way,-way by-way doing-way right:-way
I-way have-way heard-way these-way words,-way but-way I-way have-way seen-way no-way such-way men.-way

12.-way Ching,-way Duke-way of-way Ch'i,-way had-way a-way thousand-way teams-way of-way horses;-way but-way the-way
people,-way on-way his-way death-way day,-way found-way no-way good-way in-way him-way to-way praise.-way Po-yi[147]-way
and-way Shu-ch'i[148]-way starved-way at-way the-way foot-way of-way Shou-yang,-way and-way to-way this-way day-way
the-way people-way still-way praise-way them.-way

Is-way not-way this-way the-way clue-way to-way that?-way

[Footnote-way 148:-way See-way note-way to-way Book-way V,-way §-way 22.]-way

13.-way Ch'en-way K'ang[149]-way asked-way Po-yü,[150]-way Apart-way from-way us,-way have-way ye-way heard-way

He-way answered,-way No:-way once-way as-way my-way father-way stood-way alone-way and-way I-way sped-way across-way the-way

Another-way day,-way when-way he-way again-way stood-way alone-way and-way I-way sped-way across-way the-way hall,-way he-way

was-way out,-way and-way went-way to-way thank-way him.-way They-way met-way on-way the-way road.-way

He-way said-way to-way Confucius,-way Come,-way let-way us-way speak-way together.-way To-way cherish-way a-way gem,-way
and-way undo-way the-way kingdom,-way can-way that-way be-way called-way love?-way

It-way cannot,-way said-way Confucius.-way

To-way love-way office,-way and-way miss-way the-way hour-way again-way and-way again,-way can-way that-way be-way called-way
wisdom?-way

It-way cannot,-way said-way Confucius.-way

The-way days-way and-way months-way go-way by;-way the-way years-way do-way not-way wait-way for-way us.-way

True,-way said-way Confucius;-way I-way must-way take-way office.-way

2.-way The-way Master-way said,-way Men-way are-way near-way to-way each-way other-way by-way nature;-way the-way lives-way
they-way lead-way sunder-way them.-way

3.-way The-way Master-way said,-way Only-way the-way wisest-way and-way stupidest-way of-way men-way never-way change.-way

4.-way As-way the-way Master-way came-way to-way Wu-ch'eng[152]-way he-way heard-way sounds-way of-way lute-way and-way
song.-way

Why-way use-way an-way ox-knife-way to-way kill-way a-way fowl?-way said-way the-way Master,-way with-way a-way pleased-way
smile.-way

Tzu-yu-way answered,-way Master,-way once-way I-way heard-way you-way say,-way A-way gentleman-way that-way has-way

[Footnote-way 152:-way A-way very-way small-way town,-way of-way which-way the-way disciple-way Tzu-yu-way was-way

My-way two-three-way boys,-way said-way the-way Master,-way what-way Yen[153]-way says-way is-way true.-way I-way

5.-way Kung-shan-way Fu-jao[154]-way held-way Pi-way in-way rebellion.-way He-way called-way the-way Master,-way
who-way wished-way to-way go.-way

Tzu-lu-way said-way in-way displeasure.-way This-way cannot-way be!-way why-way must-way ye-way go-way to-way
Kung-shan?-way

The-way Master-way said,-way He-way calls-way me,-way and-way would-way that-way be-way all?-way Could-way I-way not-way make-way
an-way Eastern-way Chou[155]-way of-way him-way that-way uses-way me?-way

6.-way Tzu-chang-way asked-way Confucius-way what-way is-way love.-way

Confucius-way said,-way Love-way is-way to-way mete-way out-way five-way things-way to-way all-way below-way heaven.-way

May-way I-way ask-way what-way they-way are?-way

Modesty-way and-way bounty,-way said-way Confucius,-way truth,-way earnestness-way and-way kindness.-way
Modesty-way escapes-way insult:-way bounty-way wins-way the-way many;-way truth-way gains-way men's-way trust;-way
earnestness-way brings-way success;-way and-way kindness-way is-way enough-way to-way make-way men-way work.-way

7.-way Pi-way Hsi-way called-way the-way Master,-way who-way wished-way to-way go.-way

Tzu-lu-way said,-way Master,-way I-way heard-way you-way say-way once,-way To-way men-way whose-way own-way life-way is-way
evil,-way no-way gentleman-way will-way go.-way Pi-way Hsi-way holds-way Chung-mou-way in-way rebellion;-way how-way
could-way ye-way go-way to-way him,-way Sir?-way

Yes,-way I-way said-way so,-way answered-way the-way Master.-way But-way is-way not-way a-way thing-way called-way hard-way

8.-way The-way Master-way said,-way Hast-way thou-way heard-way the-way six-way words,-way Yu,[156]-way and-way the-way
six-way they-way sink-way into?-way

He-way answered.-way No.-way

Sit-way down,-way and-way I-way shall-way tell-way thee.-way The-way thirst-way for-way love,-way without-way love-way of-way
learning,-way sinks-way into-way simpleness.-way Love-way of-way knowledge,-way without-way love-way of-way
learning,-way sinks-way into-way vanity.-way Love-way of-way truth,-way without-way love-way of-way learning,-way
sinks-way into-way cruelty.-way Love-way of-way straightness,-way without-way love-way of-way learning,-way

into-way turbulence.-way Love-way of-way strength,-way without-way love-way of-way learning,-way sinks-way
into-way oddity.-way

9.-way The-way Master-way said,-way My-way little-way children,-way why-way do-way ye-way not-way learn-way poetry?-way
Poetry-way would-way ripen-way you;-way teach-way you-way insight,-way friendliness-way and-way
forbearance;-way show-way you-way how-way to-way serve-way your-way father-way at-way home;-way and-way teach-way your-way
lord-way abroad;-way and-way it-way would-way teach-way you-way the-way names-way of-way many-way birds-way and-way
beasts,-way plants-way and-way trees.-way

10.-way The-way Master-way said-way to-way Po-yü,[157]-way Hast-way thou-way done-way the-way Chou-nan-way and-way
Shao-nan?[158]-way He-way that-way has-way not-way done-way the-way Chou-nan-way and-way Shao-nan-way is-way like-way
a-way man-way standing-way with-way his-way face-way to-way the-way wall.-way

11.-way The-way Master-way said,-way 'Courtesy,-way courtesy,'-way is-way the-way cry;-way but-way are-way jade-way
and-way silk-way the-way whole-way of-way courtesy?-way 'Music,-way music,'-way is-way the-way cry;-way but-way are-way
bells-way and-way drums-way the-way whole-way of-way music?-way

12.-way The-way Master-way said,-way Fierce-way looks-way and-way weakness-way within-way are-way like-way the-way
small-way man,-way like-way the-way thief-way that-way breaks-way through-way or-way clambers-way over-way a-way wall.-way

13.-way The-way Master-way said,-way The-way plain-way townsman-way is-way the-way bane-way of-way mind.-way

14.-way The-way Master-way said,-way To-way tell-way unto-way the-way dust-way all-way that-way we-way hear-way upon-way the-way
way-way is-way to-way lay-way waste-way the-way mind.-way

15.-way The-way Master-way said,-way How-way can-way we-way serve-way the-way king-way with-way a-way low-way fellow,-way who-way
is-way itching-way to-way get-way what-way he-way wants-way and-way trembling-way to-way lose-way what-way he-way has?-way
This-way trembling-way to-way lose-way what-way he-way has-way may-way lead-way him-way anywhere.-way

16.-way The-way Master-way said,-way Men-way of-way old-way had-way three-way failings,-way which-way have,-way
perhaps,-way died-way out-way to-day.-way Ambitious-way men-way of-way old-way were-way not-way nice;-way now-way they-way
are-way unprincipled.-way Stern-way men-way of-way old-way were-way hard;-way now-way they-way are-way
quarrelsome.-way Ignorant-way men-way of-way old-way were-way straight;-way now-way they-way are-way false.-way
That-way is-way all.-way

17.-way The-way Master-way said,-way Smooth-way words-way and-way fawning-way looks-way are-way seldom-way found-way
with-way love.-way

18.-way The-way Master-way said,-way I-way hate-way the-way ousting-way of-way scarlet-way by-way purple.-way I-way hate-way
the-way strains-way of-way Cheng,-way confounders-way of-way sweet-way music.-way I-way hate-way a-way sharp-way
tongue,-way the-way ruin-way of-way kingdom-way and-way home.-way

19.-way The-way Master-way said,-way I-way wish-way no-way word-way were-way spoken!-way

Tzu-kung-way said,-way Sir,-way if-way ye-way said-way no-way word,-way what-way could-way your-way little-way
children-way write?-way

The-way Master-way said,-way What-way are-way the-way words-way of-way Heaven?-way The-way four-way seasons-way pass,-way
the-way hundred-way things-way bear-way life.-way What-way are-way the-way words-way of-way Heaven?-way

20.-way Ju-way Pei-way wished-way to-way see-way Confucius.-way Confucius-way pleaded-way sickness;-way but,-way
as-way the-way messenger-way left-way his-way door,-way he-way took-way a-way lute-way and-way sang,-way so-way the-way
messenger-way should-way hear.-way

21.-way Tsai-way Wo[159]-way asked-way about-way mourning-way for-way three-way years.-way He-way thought-way that-way
one-way was-way enough.-way

If-way for-way three-way years-way gentlemen-way forsake-way courtesy,-way courtesy-way must-way suffer.-way
If-way for-way three-way years-way they-way forsake-way music,-way music-way must-way decay.-way The-way old-way grain-way
passes,-way the-way new-way grain-way sprouts,-way the-way round-way of-way woods-way for-way the-way fire-drill-way
is-way ended-way in-way one-way year.-way

The-way Master-way said,-way Feeding-way on-way rice,-way clad-way in-way brocade,-way couldst-way thou-way be-way at-way
rest?-way

I-way could,-way he-way answered.-way

Then-way do-way what-way gives-way thee-way rest.-way But-way a-way gentleman,-way when-way he-way is-way mourning,-way
has-way no-way taste-way for-way sweets-way and-way no-way ear-way for-way music;-way he-way cannot-way rest-way in-way his-way
home.-way So-way he-way gives-way these-way up.-way Now,-way they-way give-way thee-way rest;-way then-way keep-way them.-way

After-way Tsai-way Wo-way had-way gone,-way the-way Master-way said,-way Yü's[160]-way want-way of-way love!-way At-way
the-way age-way of-way three-way a-way child-way first-way leaves-way the-way arms-way of-way his-way father-way and-way
mother,-way and-way mourning-way lasts-way for-way three-way years-way everywhere-way below-way heaven.-way
But-way did-way Yü-way have-way for-way three-way years-way the-way love-way of-way his-way father-way and-way mother?-way

22.-way The-way Master-way said,-way It-way is-way hard-way indeed-way when-way a-way man-way eats-way his-way fill-way all-way
day,-way and-way has-way nothing-way to-way task-way the-way mind!-way Could-way he-way not-way play-way at-way chequers?-way
Even-way that-way were-way better.-way

23.-way Tzu-lu-way said,-way Do-way gentlemen-way honour-way daring?-way

They-way put-way right-way higher,-way said-way the-way Master.-way With-way daring-way and-way no-way sense-way of-way
right-way gentlemen-way turn-way rebels-way and-way small-way men-way turn-way robbers.-way

24.-way Tzu-kung-way said,-way Do-way gentlemen-way hate-way too?-way

[Footnote-way 159:-way A-way disciple.]-way

[Footnote-way 160:-way Tsai-way Wo.]-way

They-way do,-way said-way the-way Master.-way They-way hate-way the-way sounding-way of-way evil-way deeds;-way they-way
hate-way men-way of-way low-way estate-way that-way slander-way those-way over-way them;-way they-way hate-way daring-way
without-way courtesy;-way they-way hate-way men-way that-way are-way stout-way and-way fearless,-way but-way
blind.-way

And-way Tz'u,[161]-way he-way said,-way dost-way thou-way hate-way too?-way

I-way hate-way those-way that-way take-way spying-way for-way wisdom,-way who-way take-way want-way of-way manners-way for-way
courage,-way and-way take-way tale-telling-way for-way honesty.-way

25.-way The-way Master-way said,-way Only-way maids-way and-way serving-lads-way are-way hard-way to-way train.-way If-way
we-way draw-way near-way to-way them,-way they-way get-way unruly;-way if-way we-way hold-way them-way off,-way they-way grow-way
spiteful.-way

26.-way The-way Master-way said,-way When-way a-way man-way of-way forty-way is-way hated,-way he-way will-way be-way so-way to-way
the-way end.-way

6.-way Ch'ang-chü-way and-way Chieh-ni-way were-way working-way in-way the-way fields.-way As-way Confucius-way

which-way is-way not-way honest;-way can-way they-way be-way said-way to-way be,-way or-way said-way not-way to-way be?-way

3.-way The-way disciples-way of-way Tzu-hsia-way asked-way Tzu-chang-way whom-way we-way should-way choose-way as-way
our-way companions.-way

Tzu-chang-way said.-way What-way does-way Tzu-hsia-way say?-way

They-way answered,-way Tzu-hsia-way says,-way If-way the-way men-way be-way well-way for-way thee,-way go-way with-way
them;-way if-way they-way be-way not-way well,-way push-way them-way off.-way

Tzu-chang-way said.-way This-way is-way not-way the-way same-way as-way what-way I-way had-way heard.-way A-way gentleman-way
honours-way worth-way and-way bears-way with-way the-way many.-way He-way applauds-way goodness-way and-way pities-way
weakness.-way If-way I-way were-way a-way man-way of-way great-way worth,-way what-way could-way I-way not-way bear-way with-way
in-way others?-way If-way I-way am-way without-way worth,-way men-way will-way push-way me-way off:-way why-way should-way I-way
push-way other-way men-way off?-way

4.-way Tzu-hsia-way said,-way Though-way there-way must-way be-way things-way worth-way seeing-way along-way small-way
ways,-way a-way gentleman-way does-way not-way follow-way them,-way for-way fear-way of-way being-way left-way at-way last-way
in-way the-way mire.-way

5.-way Tzu-hsia-way said,-way He-way that-way each-way day-way remembers-way his-way failings-way and-way each-way
month-way forgets-way nothing-way won-way may-way be-way said-way to-way love-way learning-way indeed!-way

6.-way Tzu-hsia-way said,-way By-way wide-way learning-way and-way singleness-way of-way will,-way by-way keen-way
questions-way and-way home-way thinking-way we-way reach-way love.-way

7.-way Tzu-hsia-way said,-way To-way master-way the-way hundred-way trades,-way apprentices-way work-way in-way a-way
shop;-way by-way learning,-way a-way gentleman-way finds-way his-way way.-way

8.-way Tzu-hsia-way said,-way The-way small-way man-way must-way always-way gloss-way his-way faults.-way

9.-way Tzu-hsia-way said,-way A-way gentleman-way changes-way thrice.-way Looking-way up-way to-way him-way he-way
seems-way stern;-way as-way we-way draw-way near,-way he-way warms;-way but-way his-way speech,-way when-way we-way hear-way
it,-way is-way sharp.-way

10.-way Tzu-hsia-way said,-way Until-way they-way trust-way him,-way a-way gentleman-way lays-way no-way burdens-way
on-way his-way people.-way If-way they-way do-way not-way trust-way him,-way they-way will-way think-way it-way cruel.-way
Until-way they-way trust-way him,-way he-way does-way not-way chide-way them.-way Unless-way they-way trust-way him,-way
it-way will-way seem-way fault-finding.-way

11.-way Tzu-hsia-way said,-way If-way we-way keep-way within-way the-way bounds-way of-way honour,-way we-way can-way step-way
to-way and-way fro-way through-way propriety.-way

12.-way Tzu-yu-way said,-way The-way disciples,-way the-way little-way sons-way of-way Tzu-hsia,-way can-way
sprinkle-way and-way sweep,-way attend-way and-way answer,-way come-way in-way and-way go-way out;-way but-way what-way
can-way come-way of-way twigs-way without-way roots?-way

When-way Tzu-hsia-way heard-way this,-way he-way said,-way Yen-way Yu[173]-way is-way wrong.-way If-way we-way teach-way
one-way thing-way in-way the-way way-way of-way a-way gentleman-way first,-way shall-way we-way tire-way before-way
reaching-way the-way next?-way Thus-way plants-way and-way trees-way differ-way in-way size.-way Should-way the-way
way-way of-way a-way gentleman-way bewilder-way him?-way To-way learn-way it,-way first-way and-way last,-way none-way but-way
the-way holy-way are-way fit.-way

[Footnote-way 173:-way Tzu-yu.]-way

13.-way Tzu-hsia-way said,-way A-way servant-way of-way the-way crown-way should-way give-way his-way spare-way
strength-way to-way learning.-way With-way his-way spare-way strength-way a-way scholar-way should-way serve-way
the-way crown.-way

14.-way Tzu-yu-way said,-way Mourning-way should-way stretch-way to-way grief,-way and-way stop-way there.-way

15.-way Tzu-yu-way said,-way Our-way friend-way Chang[174]-way can-way do-way hard-way things,-way but-way love-way is-way
not-way yet-way his.-way

16.-way Tseng-tzu-way said,-way Chang-way is-way so-way spacious,-way so-way lordly,-way that-way at-way his-way side-way
it-way is-way hard-way to-way do-way what-way love-way bids.-way

17.-way Tseng-tzu-way said,-way I-way have-way heard-way the-way Master-way say,-way Man-way never-way shows-way what-way
is-way in-way him-way unless-way it-way be-way in-way mourning-way those-way dear-way to-way him.-way

18.-way Tseng-tzu-way said,-way I-way have-way heard-way the-way Master-way say,-way In-way all-way else-way we-way may-way be-way
as-way good-way a-way son-way as-way Meng-way Chuang,-way but-way in-way not-way changing-way his-way father's-way
ministers,-way or-way his-way father's-way rule,-way he-way is-way hard-way to-way match.-way

19.-way The-way Meng[175]-way made-way Yang-way Fu[176]-way Chief-way Knight,[177]-way who-way spake-way to-way
Tseng-tzu-way about-way it.-way

Tseng-tzu-way said,-way Those-way above-way have-way lost-way their-way way,-way the-way people-way have-way long-way
been-way astray.-way When-way thou-way dost-way get-way at-way the-way truth,-way be-way moved-way to-way pity,-way not-way
puffed-way with-way joy.-way

20.-way Tzu-kung-way said,-way Chou[178]-way was-way not-way so-way very-way wicked!-way Thus-way a-way gentleman-way
hates-way to-way live-way in-way a-way hollow,-way down-way into-way which-way runs-way all-way that-way is-way foul-way below-way
heaven.-way

21.-way Tzu-kung-way said,-way A-way gentleman's-way faults-way are-way like-way the-way eating-way of-way sun-way or-way
moon.[179]-way All-way men-way see-way them,-way and-way when-way he-way mends-way all-way men-way look-way up-way to-way him.-way

22.-way Kung-sun-way Ch'ao-way of-way Wei-way asked-way Tzu-kung,-way From-way whom-way did-way Chung-ni[180]-way
learn?-way

Tzu-kung-way said,-way The-way Way-way of-way Wen-way and-way Wu[181]-way has-way not-way fallen-way into-way ruin.-way It-way
lives-way in-way men:-way the-way big-way in-way big-way men,-way the-way small-way in-way small-way men.-way In-way none-way of-way
them-way is-way the-way Way-way of-way Wen-way and-way Wu-way missing.-way How-way should-way the-way Master-way not-way learn-way
it?-way What-way need-way had-way he-way for-way a-way set-way teacher?-way

23.-way In-way talk-way with-way the-way great-way men-way of-way the-way court-way Shu-sun-way Wu-shu[182]-way said,-way
Tzu-kung-way is-way worthier-way than-way Chung-ni.-way

Tzu-fu-way Ching-po-way told-way this-way to-way Tzu-kung.-way

Tzu-kung-way said,-way This-way is-way like-way the-way palace-way wall.-way My-way wall-way reaches-way to-way the-way
shoulder:-way peeping-way over-way you-way see-way the-way good-way home-way within.-way The-way Master's-way wall-way

24.-way Shu-sun-way Wu-shu-way cried-way down-way Chung-ni.-way

Tzu-kung-way said,-way It-way is-way labour-way lost.-way Chung-ni-way cannot-way be-way cried-way down.-way The-way
greatness-way of-way other-way men-way is-way a-way hummock,-way over-way which-way we-way can-way still-way leap.-way
Chung-ni-way is-way the-way sun-way or-way moon,-way which-way no-way one-way can-way overleap.-way Though-way the-way man-way
were-way willing-way to-way kill-way himself,-way how-way could-way he-way hurt-way the-way sun-way or-way moon?-way That-way

2.-way Tzu-chang-way asked-way Confucius,-way How-way should-way men-way be-way governed?-way

The-way Master-way said,-way To-way govern-way men-way we-way must-way honour-way five-way fair-way things-way and-way
spurn-way four-way evil-way things.-way

Tzu-chang-way said,-way What-way are-way the-way five-way fair-way things?-way

The-way Master-way said,-way A-way gentleman-way is-way kind,-way but-way not-way wasteful;-way he-way burdens,-way
but-way he-way does-way not-way embitter;-way he-way is-way covetous,-way but-way not-way greedy;-way high-minded,-way

kindness-way without-way waste?-way If-way burdens-way be-way sorted-way to-way strength,-way who-way will-way
